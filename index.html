        <h2> Some Lovin' and Understandin'</h2>

            <div class="trans"><p> As a society, we tend to focus on the negative a lot more than the positive. Almost every time you visit CNN or some other major news outlet’s site there is always some horrible event that has taken place. Grant it, they’re doing their job and that can be expected of them but not all news is bad news. Inspired by the famous Marvin Gaye hit, "What's Going On" is a site where we can diplay the good and positve going on in our community. We're making it our mission to bring some love and understanding to the world around us. So, feel free to browse and talk to us so you can see what's going on. </p>
